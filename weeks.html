				<div class="text" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; text-align: right; display: block;">Navrachana Higher Secondary School has taken part in the International Plastic Project. We kick-started the project on<br>
				Earth Day ie 22nd April. Over the past 50 years, world plastic production has doubled. The student community has thus<br>
				come together to spread awareness about the history of plastic, its various types, and the known yet ignored facts<br>
				pertaining to it. Our IT team has designed E-posters have for the same. A short film has been made where we have<br>
				categorized different types of plastics and we have emphasized more on the solutions and alternatives. Tremendous<br>
				research work was done to collect the correct information and facts. We also had group discussions, and various<br>
				activities so as to make this process more interesting and productive. With the guidance of our teachers, the students<br>
				made sure that the information reaches a large number of masses through social media.<br>
				The first week encouraged us to reflect on what we should do to make our planet a more sustainable place. The students<br>
				actively participated in the first week and Navrachana will continue to contribute positively towards the project</div>
